            <p>Hello there!</p>
            <p>My name is Alistair Crook, and I am a third (and final) year student at the University of Warwick, studying for a BSci in Computer Science. In my spare time, I enjoy making music and games development.</p>
            <p>I first got into programming at age four, by way of the <u><a href="http://www.livewires.org.uk">Livewires holiday camp</a></u>. This course isn't traditionally open to four year olds, but given my parents were running it, they had to put me <i>somewhere</i>, and the programming room was as good a place as any. My first experiences with coding were remaking classic games such Space War and Defender in PyGame, and since then I've been hooked. The desire to make games was what got me into coding, and it still drives me to this day.</p>
            <p>Since then, I've gained experience in software development (and computing in general) through higher education (an A Level in computing followed by a degree in Computer Science at the University of Warwick); through work experience (various summers working at <u><a href="http://www.kynesim.com">Kynesim Ltd.</a></u> and <u><a href="http://www.lingumi.com">Lingumi Ltd.</a></u>); and through numerous personal projects.</p>
            <p>Outside of programming and game design, I'm an avid violinist and vocalist. As a singer, I'm an active member of the UK Filking community, and was invited (along with my sisters) as the special guests to <u><a href="http://www.filkcontinental.de">FilkContinental</a></u> 2015 in Wernigerode, Germany. As a violinist, I was a member of  <u><a href="http://www.cambridgeshiremusic.org/awards-and-opportunities/cambridge-heidelberg-montpelier-youth-orchestra.html">CHMYO</a></u> for several years, performing with them in various locations internationally.</p>
